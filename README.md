# React Components Challenge

In this challenge, you will have to break down an entire page design into small components.

How small? 

Well, that's depends on you!

But we will discuss when do we need to break it into smaller/bigger pieces. 

In the [solution branch](https://github.com/Masterschool-Web/react_components_challenge/tree/solution) you can find my approach to 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run the project

Inside the project's directory:
```npm start```
This should open a tab inside your browser with the project already running.

## üéØ Goal

Unlike challenges we did before, there is no "one right answer" for this challenge.

The general goal is to break apart the code of the entire page into smaller pieces - or "Components". 

These components should be reusable. So for example, the `Card` component should be used for all card. 

We should not have a `MortyCard` and a `SummerCard`, but the data of "Morty" and "Summer" should be inserted into the `Card` component to present different cards. 

In other words, component should be general enough to be reused many time, and not too specific to be used only once (beside some exceptions).

## Design

The design is already created for you (in the css file). 
The entire page is working, you need to take it apart and make sure it is still working :)

## First Step 

Before start coding, visualize how you want to break down the design. For example:

<img width="1358" alt="components" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31222514/195376154-38259e8b-178f-4538-b23c-5f45c583b44c.png">
